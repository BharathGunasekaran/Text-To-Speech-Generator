# Text-To-Speech-Generator
The Text-to-Speech offers an intuitive interface using Python's tkinter, with pyttsx3 and gTTS for TTS functionality. 

The Text-to-Speech (TTS) application provides an intuitive and interactive interface for converting text into speech. It is built using Python's `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface and integrates `pyttsx3` and `gTTS` for TTS functionality.

Key Features:

1. Text Input : Users can enter the text they wish to convert into speech.
2. Language Selection : The application supports multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Tamil. Users can select their preferred language from a dropdown menu.
3. Voice Selection : Depending on the chosen language, users can select between male and female voices. For languages supported by `pyttsx3` (primarily English), distinct male and female voices are available. For other languages supported by `gTTS`, a single voice type is used.
4. Speech Rate and Volume Adjustment : Users can adjust the speech rate and volume using sliders to customize the speech output according to their preferences.
5. Playback Controls : The application includes buttons to play, pause, stop, and save the generated speech. Users can manage the playback effectively with these controls.
6. Save Audio : Users can save the generated speech as an audio file in popular formats (MP3, WAV) for offline use or sharing.
7. Error Handling : The application provides user-friendly error handling, displaying warnings and error messages when necessary.

This TTS application is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, making it easy for users to convert text into speech in various languages and save the output for later use.
